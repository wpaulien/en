After three years, my time at LUCA has passed by wonderfully well, and I'm currently finishing off my final semester. The first semster of my third year, I did an Erasmus exchange program at Sydney College of the Arts (SCA), part of the University of Sydney (USYD), in Sydney, Australia. Having now returned to Ghent, I'm expected to graduate with my bachelor diploma in July this year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Whilst attending &nbsp;high school at La Grande Boissiere (LGB) - International School of Geneva, in Geneva, Switzerland, I discovered clay as a medium during after-school art classes. I loved spending time with the material, as it gave me a chance to work with my hands. When high school graduation came around the corner, I started considering an art direction for my further studies, specifically with clay. I discovered that LUCA School of Arts in Ghent, Belgium, offered me the chance to study ceramics, along with glass. Glass was then a new medium for me and a completely new expierence.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As I've mentioned above, I spent 6 months on an exchange program at Sydney College of the Arts (SCA) in Sydney, Australia. The number of exchange locations that LUCA had provided its students to choose from were immense. I was astonished by the rich variety in materials and workshops the SCA campus provided its students. They had an unbelievable workplace and the opportunities for glass and ceramics were particularly extensive. Its educational system is very different from LUCA's system. I had to create technical and practical works at SCA. In order to do so, I studied the materials I used to the core, and learned how to create functional objects. I worked mainly with hot glass, and was really able to broaden my experience and view within the material. I also briefly worked with wood and silversmithing, which allowed me to see how they could coopoerate with glass.&nbsp;</p></div>
